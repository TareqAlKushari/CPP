# C++ Project Collection

This repository contains a variety of C++ projects and sample applications, each organized in its own subdirectory. The projects cover a range of topics from banking systems to attendance management and car-related systems, making this repository a helpful resource for learning and practicing C++ programming concepts.

## Contents

Each project is separated into its own folder.

- **Account-Bank**: Simple banking system simulation.
- **Attendance-Management**: Tool for tracking and managing attendance records.
- **Car**: Car-related management program.
- **Cars-Systems-Using-Data-Structure**: Demonstrates data structures in a car management context.
- **Class-Result**: Class result processing and management.
- **College-Registration**: College student registration system.
- **Courses**: Course management utilities.
- **Data-Structures-In-Structure**: Illustrations of data structure usage.
- **Doctors-Appointment**: Doctor appointment scheduling system.
- **Employees / Employees-Advanced**: Employee management and HR tools.
- **Files**: File handling utilities and demonstrations.
- **Grade-Book**: Student grade management system.
- **Hotel-Management**: Hotel and customer management application.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrations of object-oriented inheritance in C++.
- **Library-Management**: Library and book management system.
- **Parking-Charges**: Parking charge calculation tool.
- **Staff-Management**: Staff record and management software.
- **String-Stream**: Utilities for string and stream manipulation.
- **Student-Registration / Student-Result**: Student registration and result processing.


## Structure

Each subdirectory typically contains:
- `main.cpp` or equivalent source files
- Supporting headers (`.h`) and implementation files (`.cpp`)
- Project files for IDEs (such as `.cbp` for Code::Blocks)
- Sample data files and binaries (where applicable)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/CPP.git
   ```

2. **Build & Run**
   - Navigate to a project directory.
       ```bash
       cd CPP/Account-Bank
       ```
   - Use your favorite C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio) or compile via terminal:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o output
     ```
   - Run the executable:
     ```bash
     ./output
     ```

   - Some projects may require compilation of multiple source files or additional setup as described in their respective directories.

3. **Dependencies**
   - All projects are written in standard C++.
   - Some projects may include IDE-specific files, but code is portable to any standard C++ environment.
