# C++

Welcome to the **CPP** repository by [Tareq Al Kushari](https://github.com/TareqAlKushari). This project is a comprehensive collection of C++ programs and mini-systems covering a wide range of concepts including object-oriented programming, file handling, data structures, and small management systems for educational purposes.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a standalone project or concept. Below are the major components:

### 🚀 Mini Systems & Applications
- **Account-Bank**: A simple bank account management system using classes.
- **Attendance-Management**: Tracks student attendance with basic file I/O.
- **Car**: Basic car data operations.
- **Cars-Systems-Using-Data-Structure**: Demonstrates data structures applied to vehicle management.
- **Class-Result**: Class result processing system.
- **College-Registration**: Student course registration system.
- **Courses**: A simple academic courses management tool.
- **Doctors-Appointment**: Manages patient appointments with doctors.
- **Employees & Employees-Advanced**: Employee management systems demonstrating class usage and data storage.
- **Grade-Book**: Object-oriented grade book system with modification capabilities.
- **Hotel-Management**: A comprehensive hotel management system with customers, rooms, and booking logic.
- **Inheritance**: Illustrates C++ inheritance concepts.
- **Library-Management**: A small system to issue, return, and search for library books.
- **Parking-Charges**: Calculates parking charges based on duration.
- **Staff-Management**: Basic employee management system for staff.
- **Student-Registration**: Handles registration and report generation for students.
- **Student-Result**: Result generation using student data.

### 📚 Core Concepts & Demos
- **Data-Structures-In-Structure**: Explores nesting data structures inside structures.
- **Files**: File input/output operations demo.
- **String-Stream**: Demonstrates parsing and stringstream usage in C++.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **C++**: Primary programming language.
- **Code::Blocks IDE**: Many projects contain `.cbp` (Code::Blocks Project) files.
- **Standard Libraries**: iostream, fstream, sstream, string, etc.

## 💡 Features

- Real-life simulation of small systems (library, hotel, bank, etc.)
- File-based persistent storage using `.dat` files
- Use of OOP principles: classes, inheritance, encapsulation
- Demonstrations of parsing, data structures, and modular programming

## 🛠 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
