## Structure üìÅ

Each subdirectory typically contains:
- `main.cpp` or equivalent source files
- Supporting headers (`.h`) and implementation files (`.cpp`)
- Project files for IDEs (such as `.cbp` for Code::Blocks)
- Sample data files and binaries (where applicable)

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/CPP.git
   ```

2. **Build & Run**
   - Navigate to a project directory.
     ```bash
     cd CPP/Account-Bank
     ```
   - Use your favorite C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio) or compile via terminal:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o output
     ```
   - Run the executable:
     ```bash
     ./output
     ```

   - Some projects may require compilation of multiple source files or additional setup as described in their respective directories.

3. **Dependencies**
   - All projects are written in standard C++.
   - Some projects may include IDE-specific files, but code is portable to any standard C++ environment.
